<h2><b>Deliverables</b></h2>

<h4>
1) Run the server as it is and notice what is written to the command window as you click on the links. What is going on here? (Short paragraph or two.) <br>
</h4>
-- First of all when the server is ran, it gives you the time and status that the server started. Now clicking links it first shows you the address(client) from where the request 
is made then followed by date/time and type of request(Get). It then follows by the what it is looking for with the version of http using. Followed by 200 response status code which means all is good. 
Things happened as how the client wanted i.e Link to the file is found, request was received and is succeeded. 
<br>
<h4>
2) Build a simple 3-5 page website. Interlink the pages so you can navigate between all of them.
Include some (at least 2) images, at least one GIF and one JPG. Change the server code to enable you to<br>
<mark>render GIFs in your web pages</mark><br>
<mark>render JPGs in your web pages</mark><br>
<mark>allow the default request (http://localhost:9000/) return index.html</mark><br>
With images working on your pages, note what is happening in the command window as you click from page to page.<br>
</h4>
-- It doing a get request first for the page and then for the image files. if it finds it we get a status code of 200 if not found then gives you a 404 just like in the case of klunk.html
