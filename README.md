HW2 Creating a simple python server

HW #2  
Simple HTTP Server
Due:
Feb 21th, 6pm

Summary
In class we built a simple socket interface. We set up a socket server, and had a client connect and communicate with the server.  In this exercise we will extend the socket server and create a very basic HTTP server.
Purpose:
To understand basic communication details at the point of the HTTP server
Build a proper HTTP response
Assignment:
Download Files From Blackboard HW2 List
Download Python from http://python.org/download/  (Be sure and download 2.7, not version 3)
The HW2.zip file has a working "site" that you should extend.  Open the server file and look over the code.  The   HTML files (*.html) are a very very basic "site" to get a sense of what's happening.  You should be able to run the server file and navigate to http://localhost:2000/index.html and click the links.   

UPDATE:  In the Python version, use port 9000.  Also Running python in windows has one additional quirk.  By default it reads a file's text, in order to have it open, and sucesfully pass the image file on in your web server you will need to explicitly tell it to open the file as a binary file.  Add the 'rb' parameter to the open file command.

f = open(curdir + sep + self.path, 'rb')

Deliverables
  1. Run the server as it is and notice what is written to the command window as you click on the links.  What is going on here?  (Short paragraph or two.)
  2. Build a simple 3-5 page website.
    1. Interlink the pages so you can navigate between all of them.
    2. Include some (at least 2) images, at least one GIF and one JPG.
Change the server code to enable you to
         1. render GIFs in your web pages
         2. render JPGs in your web pages
         3. allow the default request (http://localhost:9000/) return index.html
         4. With images working on your pages, note what is happening in the command window as you click from page to page.
